## üìå Introduction

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)]()

With the virtual keyboard, you can write on the real time images by combining the thumb and index fingers on the letter you want.

At the same time, you can simultaneously write what you type on the virtual keyboard in the note application like at the bottom left in the video.

This is not only for the note application, you can also type in with the virtual keyboard on the applications such as Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, Notepad. Hope you enjoyed it.

## üë®üíª Goals of the Contributors



- This is the implementation of the virtual keyboard, you contributors have to take it to the next step, you all can add the keypress sounds and then we can also make the keyboard layout move within the frames.
- Try to make the documentation of each step involved and contribute in the documentation folder
- Deploy the ML model in a web application
- Contribute and follow the contributing guidelines as shared

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps
Star and Fork the Repo üåü and this will keep us motivated.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnuvabSen/Virtual_Key_Board_Using_Opencv.git
```

## Requirements

You need OpenCV-Python library.
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
```
You need Mediapipe library.
```bash
pip3 install mediapipe
```
You need cvzone library. In most videos or blog posts people use cvzone with version 1.5. At first I had some issue recording to this problem because some codes are not working with cvzone with version 1.5 or higher but I addressed to those problems, and fixed them. You can use this code without worrying about version problems.
```bash
pip3 install cvzone
```
Lastly you need pynput library to use this keyboard on other applications.
```bach
pip3 install pynput
```
